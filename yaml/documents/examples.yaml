  description: "<p>Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed deep cuts to nearly all state programs while betting that Californians would agree to extend a trio of recent tax hikes in a spirit of shared sacrifice. Under what the governor characterized as an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; budget, taxpayers would be asked to dig deeper into their pockets â€” after the state's welfare program is cut in half, $1 billion is trimmed from its universities, and tens of thousands of elderly and disabled residents lose access to care at home.</p>"
