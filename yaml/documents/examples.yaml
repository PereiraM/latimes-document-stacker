  description: "<p>Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed deep cuts to nearly all state programs while betting that Californians would agree to extend a trio of recent tax hikes in a spirit of shared sacrifice. Under what the governor characterized as an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; budget, taxpayers would be asked to dig deeper into their pockets â€” after the state's welfare program is cut in half, $1 billion is trimmed from its universities, and tens of thousands of elderly and disabled residents lose access to care at home.</p>"

  description: "<p>USC President C.L. Max Nikias warned students from attending raves, which he called &ldquo;a specific danger that has become increasingly prevalent&rdquo; in Los Angeles. He specifically referred to raves held near USC at the Coliseum and Shrine Auditorium, and warned that because the hallucinogenic drug Ecstasy is common at the events, &ldquo;they present serious risks to all who attend.&rdquo; The letter, released on Jan. 26, 2011, was distributed a week before the Coliseum Commission meets, and could discuss whether to bring back the Electric Daisy Carnival rave in June to the Coliseum. A 15-year-old girl, Sasha Rodriguez, fatally overdosed on Ecstasy at the Electric Daisy Carnival in 2010.</p>"
